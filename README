                    SAMPLE CASES FOR TALYS

This directory contains sample cases.
Every sample case has its own directory with a descriptive name, and contains 
a subdirectory org/ with input files and OUR calculated results. For this, 
we used the gfortran compiler on MacOS. There is also a subdirectory new/ which, 
when you receive this package, contains only the input files.
By running the script 'verify', the sample cases are executed one by one 
and the new/ subdirectories are filled with YOUR calculated results. 

To run all sample cases, give
verify
To only run the first e.g. 2 sample case, give
verify 2

There should be no, or at most small, numerical differences between the results 
in new/ and those in org/. These differences are written to file 'outputdiff' in
each new/ directory.
At the end of every 'talys.out' file in the org/ directories the computation time 
is printed. This should give you an impression of the time it takes to 
calculate the total test set, which will probably be 1-2 hours.
The script will produce a further two files:
times.log: computer time of each sample case, to be compared with times_org.log
files_dif.log: differences in file length for each output file (should be empty)

The calculated information of interest is in the output file (called 'talys.out') 
or in the specific files per reaction channel that are created via the 
input files.

The sample cases also contain a subdirectory tex/ with a description for the
TALYS tutorial. There is also a plots/ directory with gnuplot files and
a plotting script for several sample cases.

Consult the manual for the meaning of all the used keywords and a description 
of all the sample cases.
