                    SAMPLE CASES FOR TALYS

This directory contains sample cases.
For every sample case, there is a subdirectory org/ with input files and OUR 
calculated results. For this, we used the gfortran compiler MacOS.
There is also a subdirectory new/ which, when you receive this, contains only 
the input files.
By running the script 'verify', the sample cases are executed and the new/ 
directories are filled with YOUR calculated results. 
There should be no, or at most small, numerical differences between the results 
in new/ and those in org/. These differences are written to file 'outputdiff'.
At the end of every 'output' file in the org/ directories the computation time 
is printed. This should give you an impression of the time it takes to 
calculate the total test set.
The calculated information of interest is in the output file (called 'output') 
or in the specific files per reaction channel that are created through the 
input files.

Some sample cases also contain a subdirectory plot/ with experimental data 
files and plot files.

Consult the manual for the meaning of all the used keywords and a description 
of all the sample cases.
