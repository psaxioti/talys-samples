{\bf Astrophysical reaction rates : n + ${}^{187}$Os}\newline
With TALYS, astrophysical reaction rates can be calculated.
As sample case, we took the work done in
Ref.\cite{Segawa2007} where the ${}^{187}$Os(n,$\gamma$) was studied for
the derivation of the age of the galaxy withing the
Re-Os cosmochronology. 
\subsubsection{Case a: ${}^{187}$Os(n,$\gamma$) cross section}
First, the calculated ${}^{187}$Os(n,$\gamma$) was compared with experimental data,
using the following input file

\VerbatimInput{\samples n-Os187-astro-ng/org/talys.inp}

The results are given in Fig.\ref{os187ng}.
\subsubsection{Case b: ${}^{187}$Os(n,$\gamma$) astrophysical reaction rate}
Next, the astrophysical reaction rates for neutrons on ${}^{187}$Os are computed 
with the following input file

\VerbatimInput{\samples n-Os187-astro-rate/org/talys.inp}

which produces various output files in which the reaction rates as 
function of temperature are given.
The $(n,\gamma )$ rate as given in the file {\em astrorate.g} is

Similar same numbers can be found in the file for protons, etc.
In {\em astrorate.tot} the rates for all reactions can be found.
